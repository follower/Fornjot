/// included.
///
/// The nomenclature is inspired by Boundary Representation Modelling Techniques
/// by Ian Stroud. "Curve" refers to unbounded one-dimensional geometry, while
/// while edges are bounded portions of curves.
///
/// The `D` parameter defines the dimensions in which the curve is defined.
/// Typically, only `2` or `3` make sense, which means the curve is defined on
/// a surface or in a space, respectively.
